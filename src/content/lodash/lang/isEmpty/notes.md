Checks if <code>value</code> is an empty object, collection, map, or set.

Objects are considered empty if they have no own enumerable string keyed properties.

Array-like values such as <code>arguments</code> objects, arrays, buffers, or strings are considered empty if they have a length of 0. Similarly, maps and sets are considered empty if they have a size of 0.
