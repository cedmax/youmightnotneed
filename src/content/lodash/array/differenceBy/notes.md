This method is like <a href="#difference"><code>\_.difference</code></a> except that it accepts <code>iteratee</code> which is invoked for each element of <code>array</code> and <code>values</code> to generate the criterion by which they're compared. The order and references of result values are determined by the first array. The iteratee is invoked with one argument:<br><em>(value)</em>.
