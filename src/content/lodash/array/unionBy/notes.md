This method is like <a href="#union"><code>_.union</code></a> except that it accepts <code>iteratee</code> which is invoked for each element of each <code>arrays</code> to generate the criterion by which uniqueness is computed. Result values are chosen from the first array in which the value occurs. The iteratee is invoked with one argument:<br><em>(value)</em>.
