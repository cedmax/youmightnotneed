# YOU MIGHT NOT NEED LODASH

Lodash is a great library, well crafted, battle tested and with a strong team supporting and maintaining it.

This page is a mere exercise to explore how can achieve similar functionalities in plain js: sometimes it's nice to understand the nitty gritty of what we are building or how stuff works behind the hood.

Just to be clear: **please use Lodash** â€“ just make sure you import the bits you need, not the whole library to use just one method. Some of the implementations have been simplified to make them more digestible, and they might miss edge cases covered in the original Lodash version.

There are also some [methods yet to be ported](/lodash/missing); if you want to help please [contribute on github](https://github.com/cedmax/youmightnotneed/blob/master/src/content/how-to-contribute.md).
