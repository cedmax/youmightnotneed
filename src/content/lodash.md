# YOU MIGHT NOT NEED **LODASH**

But **you should use Lodash**.

It's a great library, well crafted, battle tested and with a very skilled and active community contributing. **The goal of this project is _NOT_ to provide drop in replacements**, but to show how achieve similar functionalities in plain Javascript, to understand how things work behind the hood.

Being a lerning platform, **some implementations have been simplified to make them more digestible, and they might miss edge cases** covered in the original version.

If you think something important is missing, or plain wrong, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/cedmax/youmightnotneed/issues), just be aware we are not aiming at feature parity. There are also [quite a few methods yet to be ported](/lodash/missing); please help [contributing on github](https://github.com/cedmax/youmightnotneed/blob/master/src/content/how-to-contribute.md).
