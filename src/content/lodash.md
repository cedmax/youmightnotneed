# YOU MIGHT NOT NEED LODASH

Just to be clear: **you should probably use Lodash** â€“ just make sure you import the bits you need, not the whole library to use one method.

Lodash is a great library, well crafted, battle tested and with a strong team. This page, on the other hand, is a mere exercise to explore how to achieve similar functionalities in plain js: sometimes it's nice to understand the nitty gritty of how stuff works behind the hood.

Some of the implementations have been simplified to make them more digestible, and they might miss edge cases covered in the original Lodash version.

There are also [some methods yet to be ported](/lodash/missing); if you want to help please [contribute on github](https://github.com/cedmax/youmightnotneed/blob/master/src/content/how-to-contribute.md).
