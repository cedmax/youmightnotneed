# YOU MIGHT NOT NEED **DATE-FNS**

But **you should use date-fns**.

Not only it's a great library, battle tested and with a strong team, but also dates in javascript are a pain to work with, no point in dealing with them at a low level when there are such well crafted libraries around. **The goal of this project is _NOT_ to provide drop in replacements**, but to show how achieve similar functionalities in plain Javascript, to understand how things work behind the hood.

Being a learning platform, **some implementations have been simplified to make them more digestible, and they might miss edge cases** covered in the original version.

On top of that there are [a lot of methods yet to be ported](/date-fns/missing) including what's probably the most needed: [format](https://date-fns.org/v2.22.1/docs/format); please help [contributing on github](https://github.com/cedmax/youmightnotneed/blob/master/src/content/how-to-contribute.md).
