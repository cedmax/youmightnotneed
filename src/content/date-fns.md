# YOU MIGHT NOT NEED DATE-FNS

Just to be clear: **you should use date-fns**.

It's a great library, battle tested and with a strong team, also dates in javascript are a pain to work with, no point in dealing with them at a low level when there are such well crafted libraries around. This page, on the other hand, is a mere exercise to explore how to achieve similar functionalities in plain js: sometimes it's nice to understand the nitty gritty of how stuff works behind the hood.

Some of the implementations have been simplified to make them more digestible, and they might miss edge cases covered in the original library.

On top of that there are [a lot of methods yet to be ported](/date-fns/missing) including what's probably the most needed: [format](https://date-fns.org/v2.13.0/docs/format). Please [contribute on github](https://github.com/cedmax/youmightnotneed/blob/master/src/content/how-to-contribute.md).
