You might not need * is a collection of `You might not need ${something}` resources. 

Currently working on [Lodash](./src/content/lodash-missing.md) and [Moment.js](https://github.com/cedmax/youmightnotneed/tree/master/src/content/moment), but any suggestion is more than welcome.

Please read [how to contribute](./src/content/how-to-contribute.md) if you want to add any implementation.
